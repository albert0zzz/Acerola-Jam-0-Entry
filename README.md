# Acerola Jam 0

A 3D first-person platformer where you work as a cube deliveryman for 5 days.

Among the parcels there are unusual cubes that give the main character abilities. 

## Controls :
- **WASD** : Move
- **Space** : Jump
- **Shift** : Sprint
- **Ctrl** : Crouch
- **LMB** : Pick / Throw objects
- **RBM** : Use abilities

## Content:
- 5 available levels.
- 3 abilities that can be abused for record time.

## Known Issues:
- After the final fifth level, the ending scene doesn't trigger.

- The game was tested on a 1200dpi mouse. Therefore, it is recommended to change the sensitivity yourself for comfortable gameplay.

All of the above problems will be resolved after Jam's rating period.

## Credits :
All code, visuals, sound FX and music by me.
Created in 14 days for Acerola Jam 0 using Godot, Gimp, Audacity and Github.
